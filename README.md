This project involves an IoT-based Water quality monitoring system using an ESP32, various sensors, and an OLED display. It reads the Electroconductivity (EC), TDS, and temperature values and displays them on a 128x64 OLED screen. The data is also uploaded to the Arduino IoT Cloud for monitoring.

Components Used:
          ESP32: A powerful microcontroller with WiFi capabilities.
          
          OneWire Temperature Sensor: For reading the temperature (e.g., DS18B20).
          
          DFRobot ESP EC Sensor: Used to measure Electroconductivity (EC).
          
          ADS1115 ADC: To read the analog voltage from the EC sensor.
          
          SSD1306 OLED Display: A small 128x64 pixel display to show the temperature, TDS, and EC values.
          
          EEPROM: To store calibration data for the EC sensor.

Libraries Used:
          thingProperties.h: Auto-generated by Arduino IoT Cloud to handle cloud variables and synchronization.
          
          Wire.h: For I2C communication (OLED display and sensors).
          
          EEPROM.h: To manage reading/writing to the ESP32's EEPROM for sensor calibration.
          
          WiFi.h: For WiFi connectivity on the ESP32.
          
          OneWire.h: For OneWire communication with the temperature sensor.
          
          DallasTemperature.h: To interface with the DS18B20 temperature sensor.
          
          Adafruit_ADS1X15.h: Library to interface with the ADS1115 ADC.
          
          DFRobot_ESP_EC.h: Library for interfacing with the DFRobot EC sensor.
          
          Adafruit_GFX.h and Adafruit_SSD1306.h: Libraries for the OLED display.

Features:
          Temperature Measurement: The DS18B20 sensor provides real-time temperature data, which is used for temperature compensation of EC readings.
          
          EC and TDS Calculation: The EC sensor's voltage reading is used to calculate the Electroconductivity (EC) and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). TDS is derived from EC using the formula TDS = EC * 1000 / 2.
          
          Real-Time Display: The OLED display shows temperature, TDS (in PPM), and EC values.
          
          Cloud Integration: The ESP32 uploads sensor data to the Arduino IoT Cloud. The values can be monitored remotely using a dashboard.
          
          Calibration: The system supports EC sensor calibration via serial commands.

Pin Configuration:
GPIO 18: OneWire bus pin for the DS18B20 temperature sensor.

I2C SDA, SCL Pins: For communication with the SSD1306 OLED display.

Cloud Variables:
float ecValue: Electroconductivity value (EC).

float tDS: Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) value in parts per million (PPM).

float temperature: Temperature in degrees Celsius.

These variables are updated automatically in the Arduino IoT Cloud.


Upload the Code:

        Use the Arduino IDE to upload this sketch to your ESP32.
        
        Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed.
        
        The cloud variables will sync with the Arduino IoT Cloud, allowing remote monitoring of the TDS, EC, and temperature data.

Calibration:

The system will handle calibration automatically via the ec.calibration(voltage, temperature) function.

Calibration data is stored in the ESP32's EEPROM, so it persists across reboots.

View Data:

    The real-time data will be shown on the OLED display.
    
    The Arduino IoT Cloud dashboard will allow you to monitor the data remotely.
